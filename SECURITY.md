# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest version of StickerDocs which is available for download from https://stickerdocs.com/download.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We welcome responsible disclosures from security professionals via email at support@stickerdocs.com.

We are a micro business, so we don’t have funds to pay bounties. We will acknowledge your efforts on our security page https://stickerdocs.com/security. Thank you for helping us keep our customer’s data secure.
